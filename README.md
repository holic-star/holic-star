もっと抱きしめあうのさ
Addict!

### Intro
any pronouns / 18+ / I'm pardi, but calling me with the pony's name is fine


I love to draw, listening to vocaloid/Vtubers/SynthV/Utau/Utaite, and reading books 😄

Feel free to boop or starting conversations with me! As long as you're not rude and I'm not AFK
I'll definitely reply :>

I be AFK often in-game.
all my ponies are C+H 😉.

### Before you interact
I'm not a minor but I know the difference between talking about personal life vs about the series I like. If you're comfortable with it then go ahead.
Also please tell me if I'm being awfully close, I'm kinda awkward.
I never do accidental boop-ing, if I boop you that means I like your skin 😄

### Before add friend!!
Offline mode is enabled so I won't appear in your friendlist and my name won't be green..

### Don't interact if
- You don't like other people having the same interest as you. That's weird and kinda rude 🤔.
- Racist, ableist, too political, extremely rude, etc.
- You can't handle jokes... (I put /j. Never too serious, just for fun.)



## Extra

### Likes
Roleplay / Regular chat is OK! 😸
I don't mind if you dislike what I like btw. I have too many.

I have some ponies from: MLP, Ensemble Stars, Bungou Stray Dogs, Touhou project, Jojo's, Twisted Wonderland, Hypnosis Microphone, Mahoyaku, Land of the Lustrous and a lot of OCs :) 

I'm also into Beyblade (ori, metalfight, burst), Yu-Gi-Oh!! (0-8 except SEVENS, yes I like Go Rush!), Saint Seiya, HxH, CSM, Danganronpa, FGO, MCU, Paradox Live, Handead Anthem, A3!, K Project, Tekken, KOF, Guilty Gear, Yuru camp, Evangelion, Saiki, Ansatsu Kyoushitsu, Blue lock, Beastars, etc etc.
NGL I read MangaPlus regularly and I really like PPPPPP. Oh also Shonen Magazine (Tokrev + 7DS + Mokushiroku).
- I think these joseimuke games really do have shonen plot (except A3! & i7 which is quite shoujo imo). Feel free to fight me on this.
- I'm also an avid webtoon reader pls help. And japanese webtoon such as Nanbaka (have you seen Kojirou?)
- And a gamer as well.. other than gacha I also like RPG maker games such as End Roll, Ib, Yume Nikki (Dw I'm avoiding Okegom)

### Favorites
- HiiroP
- Alkaloid, Eden, Switch
- Pomefiore & Octavinelle
- Autumn troupe (I really love Sakyo & Itaru)
- Rustica loml and also west wizards
- Fyodor (tbh Chuuya is objectively better)
- Chiaki Nanami, Chihiro Fujisaki
- etc

### Dislikes
I don't like conversations that I can't follow. 

I have no characters I particularly dislikes. Mori Ougai is the closest one.
