Addict!

### Intro
any pronouns / 18+ / I'm pardi, but calling me with the pony's name is fine. I can speak (kinda broken) Eng/Jp thanks to Duolingo. I have a 600+ day streak someone pls saves me from this green owl/j.


I love to draw, listening to vocaloid/Vtubers/SynthV/Utau/Utaite/Cevio, and reading books. I have no diagnosed conditions (as far as I know).

Feel free to boop or starting conversations with me! As long as you're not rude and I'm not AFK
I'll definitely reply

I be AFK often in-game (when: üò¥ or ‚õî).
all my ponies are C+H.

Literally none of my IRLs play this game so ngl it's quite lonely here. Imagine liking a lot of things but could never talk about it. I sadly can't have a discord acc because of some complicated things.

### Before you interact
- I'm not a minor, but if you're comfortable with it then go ahead. I mean, it's just a neat little pony game with creative skins around and I have no means to int w/ you outside of the game. Anyway, my goal is a nice or small talk or simply vibing & sitting around.
- please tell me if I'm being awfully close, I'm kinda awkward.
- I never do accidental boop-ing, if I boop you that means I like your skin. No need to boop back but it's always appreciated :} 
- I won't interact with you if you have DNI/DNT/DNIUF/TD/TT/other variation in your name.
- I read people's intros so when they have "over 20 dni" yeah well I won't. What do I do if such ppl interact first? Welp. And that's why I play in 18+ server more often now.
<!---
### Before add friend!!
Offline mode is enabled so I won't appear in your friendlist and my name won't appear green in your screen...
I also don't know how to keep friend. I guess I'm just boring, but if you're fine with it, I'm replying.
--->

### Don't interact if
- You don't like other people having the same interest as you. That's weird and kinda rude ü§î.
- Racist, ableist, extremely political, extremely rude, proshipper, etc.
- You can't handle jokes... (I put /j. Never too serious, just for fun.)



## Extra (warning: long)

### Likes
Roleplay / Regular chat is OK!
I don't mind if you dislike what I like btw. I have too many, but mainly enstars and BSD.

I have some ponies from: MLP, Ensemble Stars, Bungou Stray Dogs, Touhou project, Jojo's, Twisted Wonderland, Hypnosis Microphone, Mahoyaku, Land of the Lustrous and a lot of OCs :) 

I'm also into Beyblade (ori, metalfight, burst), Yu-Gi-Oh!! (0-8 except SEVENS, yes I like Go Rush!), Ina11, Saint Seiya, HxH, Dragon Knights (the one by Mineko :)), Sengoku BASARA, CSM, Dgrp, FGO, MCU, Paradox Live, A3!, K-Project, Tekken, KOF, Guilty Gear, Yuru camp, Evangelion, Saiki, Ansatsu Kyoushitsu, 7DS, Tokrev, Beastars, etc etc. Not listed here: maybe I've read/watched/played it, you can test it to me. I'll try to answer üòè (as long as you're not rude yes)

I read MangaPlus regularly. PPPPPP, Sakamoto Days, Even if you slit my mouth, Cipher academy, and Dandadan are so DAMN great man I totally recommend these manga. Oh also Shonen Magazine (Blue Lock, Mokushiroku).
- I think these joseimuke games really do have shonen plot (except A3! & i7 which are quite shoujo imo). Feel free to fight me on this. Yeah A3 has spies and i7 has bombs but imo those ain't wild enough (I love A3 and i7 for the record, those just ain't that shonen to me).
- I'm also an avid manhua & manhwa reader pls help. And japanese webtoon such as Nanbaka.
- And a gamer, other than gacha I also enjoy RPG maker games such as End Roll, Ib, Yume Nikki, etc.
- Cartoons

### Favorites
- Hiiro
- AlkaloidP, EdenP, SwitchP
- Pomefiore & Octavinelle
- Autumn & Spring troupe (I really love Sakyo & Itaru overall)
- Rustica loml and the other west wizards
- Fyodor (tbh Chuuya is objectively better)
- Chiaki Nanami, Chihiro Fujisaki (they don't deserve to be in dgrp and I like their personalities)
- Yanfei is so gorgeous and for what üëë I can't play genshin but damn the art
- etc

### Dislikes
I don't like conversations that I can't follow. 

I have no character that I particularly dislike. Mori Ougai is the closest one. And ofc characters like Rachel, designed to be hated by the audience smh.
